		* ==== Multiple documents with `BulkAllObservable` helper
		*
		* Using the `BulkAllObservable` helper allows you to focus on the overall objective of indexing, without having to
		* concern yourself with retry, backoff or chunking mechanics.
		* Multiple documents can be indexed using the `BulkAll` method and `Wait()` extension method.
		*
		* This helper exposes functionality to automatically retry / backoff in the event of an indexing failure,
	    * and to control the number of documents indexed in a single HTTP request. In the example below each request will contain 1000 documents,
		* chunked from the original input. In the event of a large number of documents this could result in many HTTP requests, each containing
		* 1000 documents (the last request may contain less, depending on the total number).
		*
		* The helper will also lazily enumerate an `IEnumerable<T>` collection, allowing you to index a large number of documents easily.
