	/// This single-value aggregation approximates the median absolute deviation of its search results.
	///
	///	Median absolute deviation is a measure of variability. It is a robust statistic, meaning that
	/// it is useful for describing data that may have outliers, or may not be normally distributed.
	/// For such data it can be more descriptive than standard deviation.
	///
	///	It is calculated as the median of each data point’s deviation from the median of the
	/// entire sample. That is, for a random variable <code>X</code>, the median absolute deviation
	/// is <code>median(|median(X) - Xi|).</code>
