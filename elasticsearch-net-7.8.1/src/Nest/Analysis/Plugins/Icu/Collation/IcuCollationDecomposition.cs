	/// Setting this decomposition property to canonical allows the Collator to handle unnormalized
	/// text properly, producing the same results as if the text were normalized. If no is set, it
	/// is the user’s responsibility to insure that all text is already in the appropriate form
	/// before a comparison or before getting a CollationKey. Adjusting decomposition mode
	/// allows the user to select between faster and more complete collation behavior. Since a
	/// great many of the world’s languages do not require text normalization, most locales
	/// set no as the default decomposition mode.
